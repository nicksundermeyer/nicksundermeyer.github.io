Each player controls one character using either a controller or a keyboard/mouse combination. Players must aim their attacks, and then may swing from either the left or right. They can also parry on the left or right side, and if one player's swing hits the other's parry, they are staggered for a moment, giving an opportunity to attack. The game includes a menu and scoring system, and players fight in a best-of-three across different maps."),r.a.createElement("p",null,"The biggest challenge for me with this project was in getting the sword mechanics to work right and feel good, especially as I have no animation experience.
