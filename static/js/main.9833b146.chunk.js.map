The prompt was\n          \"what does home mean to you\", and our design concept for the game was\n          based around having a safe place to come back to that felt like home.\n          The game is a slow-paced, atmospheric survival game where the player\n          must collect wood for their fire, which is slowly burning out. The\n          player's torch also requires sticks from the fire, so they must\n          continually return home in order to delve farther and farther into the\n          darkness.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          This is a prototype made in two days, but we hope to expand the game's\n          concept beyond this first version to include more gameplay elements\n          based around the lighting mechanics we have in the game.\n        </p>\n        <p>I worked on both design and programming for the game</p>\n        <iframe\n          title=\"campfire\"\n          src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DDOMKcC879w\"\n          frameborder=\"0\"\n          allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\n          allowfullscreen\n        ></iframe>\n      </div>\n    )\n  },\n  {\n    header: \"Gravibird\",\n    categories: \"Game Development\",\n    image: \"gravibird-full.png\",\n    modalID: \"modal_gravibird\",\n    body: (\n      <div>\n        <a href=\"games/Gravibird/index.html\">Try this game running in WebGL!</a>\n        <iframe\n          title=\"gravibird\"\n          src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/onVdS1dRl34\"\n          frameborder=\"0\"\n          allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\"\n          allowfullscreen\n        ></iframe>\n        <p>\n          This was a project made for a game design class in collaboration with\n          another student. Our primary design philosophy with this piece was to\n          try to create a single-button experience, which is a challenging\n          design problem as it doesn't give you much leeway in terms of game\n          mechanics. At first, we were going to make a simple jump over\n          obstacles, but had the idea to instead incorporate the\n          gravity-switching mechanic, with some blocks that fell with the player\n          to provide an ever-changing landscape to navigate. I found this\n          mechanic particularly compelling as it gives the player the ability to\n          change the course on the fly with well-timed presses, and the\n          obstacles become almost like a secondary character that the player is\n          able to control.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Our greatest challenge with this project was probably sticking with\n          our original design idea and keeping it to only one button press. We\n          had many different ideas for mechanics to incorporate, all of which\n          would have required extra button presses, but we wanted to keep it\n          simple and avoid adding too many unnecessary things to the game. In\n          the end, I think this turned out well, and I was glad that we were\n          able to get through to a complete product by the end.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    )\n  },\n  {\n    header: \"3D Modeling Projects\",\n    categories: \"3D Work\",\n    image: \"modeling-full.png\",\n    modalID: \"modal_modeling\",\n    body: (\n      <div>\n        <p>\n          Both of these project were created for my 3D Modeling class at the\n          University of Denver, using Autodesk Maya and the Arnold renderer.\n        </p>\n        <div id=\"carouselOne\" class=\"carousel slide\" data-ride=\"carousel\">\n          <div class=\"carousel-inner\">\n            <div class=\"carousel-item active\">\n              <img\n                class=\"d-block w-100\"\n                src=\"/images/portfolio/modelingModal/Render1.png\"\n                alt=\"First slide\"\n              ></img>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"carousel-item\">\n              <img\n                class=\"d-block w-100\"\n                src=\"/images/portfolio/modelingModal/Render2.png\"\n                alt=\"Second slide\"\n              ></img>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"carousel-item\">\n              <img\n                class=\"d-block w-100\"\n                src=\"/images/portfolio/modelingModal/Render3.png\"\n                alt=\"Third slide\"\n              ></img>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"carousel-item\">\n              <img\n                class=\"d-block w-100\"\n                src=\"/images/portfolio/modelingModal/Render4.png\"\n                alt=\"Third slide\"\n              ></img>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <a\n            class=\"carousel-control-prev\"\n            href=\"#carouselOne\"\n            role=\"button\"\n            data-slide=\"prev\"\n          >\n            <span class=\"carousel-control-prev-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>\n            <span class=\"sr-only\">Previous</span>\n          </a>\n          <a\n            class=\"carousel-control-next\"\n            href=\"#carouselOne\"\n            role=\"button\"\n            data-slide=\"next\"\n          >\n            <span class=\"carousel-control-next-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>\n            <span class=\"sr-only\">Next</span>\n          </a>\n        </div>\n        <p>\n          The goal of this first project was to get comfortable with modeling\n          tools and basic materials.
