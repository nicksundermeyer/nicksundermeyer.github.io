Players try to complete each level as quickly as possible, which involves a combination of dodging various enemies and traps, as well as opening doors using special 'keys' and smashing through rock formations with a hammer.

Our primary design philosophy with this piece was to try to create a single-button experience, which is a challenging design problem as it doesn't give you much leeway in terms of game mechanics. At first, we were going to make a simple jump over obstacles, but had the idea to instead incorporate the gravity-switching mechanic, with some blocks that fell with the player to provide an ever-changing landscape to navigate. I found this mechanic particularly compelling as it gives the player the ability to change the course on the fly with well-timed presses, and the obstacles become almost like a secondary character that the player is able to control.</p>\n                <p>Our greatest challenge with this project was probably sticking with our original design idea and keeping it to only one button press. We had many different ideas for mechanics to incorporate, all of which would have required extra button presses, but we wanted to keep it simple and avoid adding too many unnecessary things to the game. In the end, I think this turned out well, and I was glad that we were able to get through to a complete product by the end.</p>\n            </div>\n    },\n    {\n        \"header\": \"3D Modeling Projects\",\n        \"categories\": \"3D Modeling\",\n        \"image\": \"modeling-full.png\",\n        \"modalID\": \"modal_modeling\",\n        \"body\":\n            <div>\n                <p>Both of these project were created for my 3D Modeling class at the University of Denver, using Autodesk Maya and the Arnold renderer.</p>\n                <div id=\"carouselOne\" class=\"carousel slide\" data-ride=\"carousel\">\n                    <div class=\"carousel-inner\">\n                        <div class=\"carousel-item active\">\n                            <img class=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/images/portfolio/modelingModal/Render1.png\" alt=\"First slide\"></img>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"carousel-item\">\n                            <img class=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/images/portfolio/modelingModal/Render2.png\" alt=\"Second slide\"></img>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"carousel-item\">\n                            <img class=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/images/portfolio/modelingModal/Render3.png\" alt=\"Third slide\"></img>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"carousel-item\">\n                            <img class=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/images/portfolio/modelingModal/Render4.png\" alt=\"Third slide\"></img>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    <a class=\"carousel-control-prev\" href=\"#carouselOne\" role=\"button\" data-slide=\"prev\">\n                        <span class=\"carousel-control-prev-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>\n                        <span class=\"sr-only\">Previous</span>\n                    </a>\n                    <a class=\"carousel-control-next\" href=\"#carouselOne\" role=\"button\" data-slide=\"next\">\n                        <span class=\"carousel-control-next-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>\n                        <span class=\"sr-only\">Next</span>\n                    </a>\n                </div>\n                <p>The goal of this first project was to get comfortable with modeling tools and basic materials.

They can also parry on the left or right side, and if one player's swing hits the other's parry, they are staggered for a moment, giving an opportunity to attack. The game includes a menu and scoring system, and players fight in a best-of-three across different maps.</p>\n                <p>The biggest challenge for me with this project was in getting the sword mechanics to work right and feel good, especially as I have no animation experience.

It was based off my love of minimalism in design, and goes for simplicity. The poster also asked for some examples of ways to save water based on the website save20gallons.org, which I put in simple text around the faucet, and used the red/white/black colors to pop different parts of the design. The poster won a design contest and was used by the Santa Clara County in California as part of a water-saving initiative.</p>\n            </div>\n    },\n    {\n        \"header\": \"High School 3D Project\",\n        \"categories\": \"3D Modeling\",\n        \"image\": \"hsmodeling-full.jpg\",\n        \"modalID\": \"modal_hsmodelling\",\n        \"body\":\n            <div>\n                <p>This is a render of a group of models that I made for an animation for the Paly Robotics team. I modeled and UV mapped four buildings (a store, a small wooden shack, a larger modern-style house, and a classic tile-roofed house), as well as the fence, viking hat, and stop sign in the image. The final models were eventually rendered in a 3rd party renderer, Octane, to improve lighting as well as add post-processing effects.</p>\n            </div>\n    }\n]\nexport default resumeData","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Modal from './portfolio-modal';\nimport portfolioData from '../../portfolioData';\nexport default class Portfolio extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <section id=\"portfolio\">\n        <div className=\"row\">\n          <div className=\"twelve columns collapsed\">\n\n            <h1>Examples of My Work</h1>\n            <div id=\"portfolio-wrapper\" className=\"bgrid-quarters s-bgrid-thirds cf\">\n              {portfolioData.map((e, i) => <Modal portfolioData={portfolioData[i]} />)}\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n        );\n  }\n}","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport resumeData from '../../resumeData';\nexport default class Footer extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n\n      <footer>\n        <div className=\"row\">\n          <div className=\"twelve columns\">\n            <ul className=\"social-links\">\n              <li><a href={resumeData.linkedin}><i className=\"fab fa-linkedin-in\"></i></a></li>\n              <li><a href={resumeData.github}><i className=\"fab fa-github\" /></a></li>\n              <li><a href={resumeData.itchio}><i className=\"fab fa-itch-io\"></i></a></li>\n              <li><a href={resumeData.mailto}><i class=\"fas fa-envelope\"></i></a></li>\n              <li><a href={resumeData.twitter}><i className=\"fab fa-twitter\" /></a></li>\n            </ul>\n          </div>\n          <div id=\"go-top\"><a className=\"smoothscroll\" title=\"Back to Top\" href=\"#home\"><i className=\"icon-up-open\" /></a></div>\n        </div>\n      </footer>\n    );\n  }\n}","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Header from './components/header/header';\nimport About from './components/about/about';\nimport Portfolio from './components/portfolio/portfolio';\nimport Footer from './components/footer/footer';\nimport resumeData from './resumeData';\nclass App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"App\">\n        <Header resumeData={resumeData} />\n        <About />\n        <Portfolio />\n        {/* <Resume /> */}\n        <Footer resumeData={resumeData}/>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\nexport default App;","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
